# Custom-Views
This repo is to document my learning about Custom views in android

### Note:
If you are trying to understand Custom views, go in order:
* CustomView1
* CupView
* Timer
* Dot Loading

Also in a branch named "sensor-cup2" you'll find the code for the tilt cup, in the CupView.kt file

## Demo:
### Cupview

(Roll is actually the angle through which I'm tilting my phone.)
* roll > 0 -> left tilt
* roll < 0 -> right tilt
